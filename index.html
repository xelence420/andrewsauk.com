      <p>
        I asked ChatGPT how to make a website from scratch and it had me copy and paste a few different things.
      </p>
      <button id="click-me-button">Click me</button>
      <p id="message"></p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>What's the point?</h2>
      <p>

        Are you sure you're not the product of chance? Perhaps some combination of the two?
